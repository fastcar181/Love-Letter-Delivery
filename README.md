## Dev Log

# Day 1: February 1, 2025
* Project setup: I set up the 2D project in Unity, and I added a .gitignore file and this README file to document my process. I also set up Git.
* Asset creation: I couldn't find free assets for the character sprites, so I made my own :3
* Importing assets: Imported the assets I created and the free ones I found.
* Added the tilesets to the tile palette.
