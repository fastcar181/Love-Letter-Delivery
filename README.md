# Love Letter Delivery (Placeholder Name)
A 2D top-down adventure game with a fun little story relating to Valentine's Day!

## Status
Currently a WIP!

## Assets
* [Fantasy Tileset](https://ventilatore.itch.io/the-fantasy-tileset)
* [RPG Icons - Edited](https://butterymilk.itch.io/tiny-wonder-rpg-icons)
* [Prototype Character Sprites](https://otterisk.itch.io/hana-caraka-base-character)

## Scope
This project is designed for me to be able to complete by Valentine's Day. Because of this time constraint, the game's mechanics will be relatively simple, and the story will be short and sweet.

## Dev Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2025
* Project Setup: The Unity UI is intimidating at first, but I had a tiny bit of experience navigating around it.
* Asset Creation: I created my first ever asset with two frames to create a simple animation. This was my first ever 16x16 asset that I've created, and it was honestly a fun and rewarding experience.
* Importing Assets: I imported the asset I created and the free assets I found on the internet.

### Day 2: February 2, 2025
* Tile Palettes: I had a busy day today, but I created and organized tile palettes with the assets I imported.

### Day 3: February 3, 2025
* Player Movement: Again, this was not a productive day because I had a math quiz to study for, but I implemented a simple player movement script. All it does right now is let the player control a sprite with WASD. There are no animations, so it just moves around in a very smooth way.
